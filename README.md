# AdGuard Home Stream Deck Plugin

## Contributing

You should create a symbolic link between where you are storing the repo and the Plugins directory (on Windows, it is at `%appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins`)

This can be done with Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) by making a directory symbolic link.

```bash
mklink /D "%appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\dev.mdawson.agh.sdPlugin" "path\to\repo\streamdeck-agh\dev.mdawson.agh.sdPlugin"
```
