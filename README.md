Big thanks to [John Holbrook's streamdeck-pihole](https://github.com/johnholbrook/streamdeck-pihole) for providing a great project, great reading material and inspiration to understand how to create the plugin

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

You will need to install VSCode or a similar IDE to use in development.

It is recommended to [enable Javascript plugin debugging ](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/create-your-own-plugin/#debugging-your-javascript-plugin) which allows you to visit [http://localhost:23654](http://localhost:23654) to use the Chrome web dev tools.

### Running Locally

You should create a symbolic link between where you are storing the repo and the Plugins directory (on Windows, it is at `%appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins`) for ease of development, rather than needing to copy the contents of the project over to the directory or having to do development at a fixed location.

This can be done on Windows with Command Prompt (cmd.exe) by making a directory symbolic link.

```bash
mklink /D "%appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\dev.mdawson.agh.sdPlugin" "path\to\repo\streamdeck-agh\dev.mdawson.agh.sdPlugin"
```
